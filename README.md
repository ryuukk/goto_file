Switch file without the annoying screen flicker from gotoanything's file previewing on each keystroke

Supports caching too

If multiple folders opened, it'll put the prefix, so it's less confusing for duplicate names

Press enter and it'll open the file

# And to make it a keybind:

- ``Preferences -> Keybind``
- ``{ "keys": ["ctrl+p"], "command": "goto_file" }``
